# stacks2d (tinyrealms)

A place to go.

Work in progress: a 2D social world and agent sandbox for creator economy and Stacks/Bitcoin-native interactions.

This project builds from the original [61cygni/tinyrealms](https://github.com/61cygni/tinyrealms) foundation, which provided a strong starting point for persistent 2D world simulation.

## At A Glance

- **What it is**: a 2D social world and customizable game foundation
- **What works now**: world rendering, map editing, multiplayer foundations, NPC runtime, Braintrust-backed AI actions
- **What it is becoming**: a sandbox for AI agents, creator economy, and Stacks/Bitcoin-native interactions
- **Why Stacks**: the architecture is being shaped for future AIBTC patterns, x402 on Stacks transaction flows, and external ecosystem adapters without coupling those concerns into the core game runtime

## Why This Matters

`stacks2d (tinyrealms)` is being developed as a practical bridge between:
- customizable 2D worldbuilding
- AI-enhanced NPC interaction
- modular agent infrastructure
- future Stacks-native economic and transaction patterns

The goal is not to overclaim finished blockchain integration.
The goal is to ship a strong game foundation now while cleanly preparing for:
- AIBTC-aligned agent tooling
- x402 on Stacks paid service flows
- creator economy mechanics
- ecosystem-driven identity, reputation, and opportunity ingestion

Internally, one of the clearest design framings is:

> Dungeons and Agents

Meaning:
- a sandbox for agents
- a world of roles, objects, value, and events
- a simulation surface that can later settle value through Stacks rails

  P --> PX[x402 API / sponsor relay]
```

## Sequential Build Path

The project is being built in a strict order to avoid technical debt and fake claims.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[1. Playable world baseline] --> B[2. Semantic world model]
  B --> C[3. Ecosystem data adapters]
  C --> D[4. Purposeful agent behaviors]
  D --> E[5. Premium content and x402]
  E --> F[6. Trading agents and onchain execution]

  A["Playable world baseline<br/>maps, movement, scenes, UI, save state"]
  B["Semantic world model<br/>zones, objects, roles, values, events"]
  C["Ecosystem data adapters<br/>Zero Authority live, Tenero next"]
  D["Purposeful agent behaviors<br/>guide, market, quests, planners"]
  E["Premium content and x402<br/>offers, payment gates, service endpoints"]
  F["Trading agents and onchain execution<br/>AIBTC-style accounts, STX, sBTC, USDCx"]
```

This order is intentional:
- do not put payment logic into rendering and movement
- do not call third-party APIs directly from the frontend
- do not claim onchain execution before payment or wallet paths are verified

## Live, Scaffolded, Planned

  P["Planned next<br/>real x402 execution<br/>Clarity proof contract<br/>purposeful agents<br/>AIBTC account execution"]
```

## Features

- **Shared 2D world** — multiplayer presence, map state, chat, and world data
- **Integrated map editor** — paint tiles, set collision, define zones, and save maps live to Convex
- **Sprite pipeline** — import sprite sheets, define animations, and render custom characters
- **NPC runtime** — server-authoritative NPC state with wandering, intent, and lightweight trading
- **AI narrative path** — Braintrust-backed dialogue and narrative generation
- **Economy primitives** — items, loot, shops, and in-world wallet records
- **Customizable foundation** — designed to support custom levels, custom characters, and future modular integrations

## Implementation Snapshot

Verified live in the current build:
- live Tenero ticker in the header
- Zero Authority opportunity cache used in-world
- dedicated surfaces for `guide.btc`, `market.btc`, and `quests.btc`
- `World Feed` driven by typed world events
- semantic world kernel and AIBTC-compatible registry in Convex
- premium offer metadata is real in Convex
- premium UI is real in the world

Scaffolded but not yet verified live:
- `services/x402-api` for premium payment-required endpoints
- guide premium payment execution
- future Clarity proof contract
- future AIBTC account execution

## Verified Backend Connector Execution

The Stacks ecosystem connectors are backend-executed and cached before the world consumes them.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  ZA[Zero Authority API] --> ZC[Convex integration cache]
  TE[Tenero API] --> TC[Convex integration cache]
  ZC --> Q[normalized queries]
  TC --> Q
  Q --> G[guide.btc / quests.btc]
  Q --> M[market.btc / HUD ticker]
  Q --> W[World Feed context]
```

Verified connector paths in the current build:
- `Zero Authority API -> Convex cache -> guideSnapshot -> guide.btc and quests.btc`
- `Tenero API -> Convex cache -> tickerRows -> HUD ticker and market.btc`

Verified by runtime/backend queries:
- `integrations/zeroAuthority:guideSnapshot`
- `integrations/tenero:tickerRows`

## Current Status

This repository is intentionally presented as a **work in progress**.

What is working now:
- web client and Convex backend
- local development flow
- map loading and editing
- multiplayer presence foundations
- NPC runtime loop
- Braintrust-backed AI actions

What is planned next:
- deeper AI agent sandbox logic
- external ecosystem ingestion
- AIBTC-aligned agent tooling
- x402 on Stacks transaction flows
- future wallet integrations

## Future GameFi Layer

The longer-term contract roadmap includes a dedicated GameFi/SFT layer informed by the Stacks GameFi tutorial on SFT acquisition, crafting, level-up, and token metadata. Source: [SFTs: Flow and Smart Contracts](https://gamefi-stacks.gitbook.io/stacks-degens-gaming-universe/sfts-flow-and-smart-contracts)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  W[world-lobby.clar<br/>world/session lifecycle] --> O[world-objects.clar<br/>object ownership and binding]
  O --> S[sft-items.clar<br/>resources, items, passes, upgrades]
  S --> X[x402 and wallet flows<br/>paid access and settlement]
```

Planned uses for the SFT layer:
- room passes and access badges
- consumable resources
- craftable and upgradeable items
- creator/media access items
- future skins, tools, and world modules

Important truth:
- this SFT layer is a planned roadmap item
- it is not implemented in the current build

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vite + TypeScript
- **Rendering**: PixiJS v8
- **Backend**: Convex (database, real-time, file storage, auth)
- **AI**: Braintrust AI Proxy
- **Future Stacks direction**: AIBTC patterns, x402 on Stacks, and modular external adapters

## Service Boundaries

The project now includes a dedicated x402 service scaffold:

```text
services/
└── x402-api/        Separate payment-required HTTP surface for premium endpoints
```

Current truth:
- the service scaffold exists in the repo
- the world-side offer metadata exists in Convex
- the in-world premium UI is real
- actual x402 payment execution is not verified until the service is installed, configured, and run

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A [Convex](https://convex.dev) account for cloud workflows, or local Convex for offline/local development
- Optionally, a [Braintrust](https://braintrust.dev) API key (for NPC AI)

### Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Initialize Convex:
   ```bash
   npx convex dev --local
   ```
   This starts a local Convex deployment and generates the `_generated` types.

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and fill in `VITE_CONVEX_URL`
   - In Convex, set these environment variables as needed:
     - `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` — local auth signing key
     - `JWKS` — local auth verification key set
     - `ADMIN_API_KEY` — local admin helper key
     - `BRAINTRUST_API_KEY` — optional AI key
     - `BRAINTRUST_MODEL` — optional model override

4. Run the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This starts both the Vite frontend and the Convex backend in parallel.

## Architecture Direction

The product is being built with clear boundaries:

- **Experience layer** — maps, characters, scenes, dialogue presentation
- **Game core** — movement, collisions, items, quests, NPC runtime state
- **AI layer** — Braintrust-backed dialogue and future agent memory / planning
- **Integration layer** — future AIBTC, Zero Authority, and x402 on Stacks adapters

This separation is intentional so the worldbuilding and asset pipeline can evolve without coupling the game client directly to external wallet or payment infrastructure.

See [docs/Stacks2D-Architecture.md](docs/Stacks2D-Architecture.md) for diagrams and module boundaries.

### Agent Framework Direction

The long-term agent architecture is layered rather than monolithic.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  U[User or agent owner] --> P[Parent agent]
  P <--> B[Basket strategy]
  O[Offchain logic<br/>Zero Authority, Tenero, LLM signals] --> B
  B --> W1[Guide strategy]
  B --> W2[Market strategy]
  B --> W3[Quest strategy]
  W1 --> N1[World node or service node]
  W2 --> N2[World node or protocol node]
  W3 --> N3[World node or service node]
```

In `stacks2d`, that means:
- the world stays the interface layer
- strategy agents stay modular
- protocol and payment execution stay behind explicit nodes
- offchain signals help orchestrate decisions without taking over the engine

### World Semantics Direction

The world is being upgraded from a painted scene to a semantic simulation.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  M[Map] --> Z[Zones]
  M --> O[Object instances]
  M --> N[NPC instances]
  Z --> T[Tags and allowed roles]
  O --> V[Value, interaction, offer state]
  N --> R[Role, post, current state]
  R --> E[Events]
  V --> E
```

This is the basis for:
- purposeful NPC movement instead of random drift
- object-aware agents
- creator economy loops
- future multi-world sandbox behavior

### Spatial Intelligence Direction

Spatial intelligence in `stacks2d` is not just “more AI chat”.

It is a layered system:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  G[1. Geometry layer] --> S[2. Semantic layer]
  S --> A[3. Affordance layer]
  A --> C[4. Agent cognition layer]
  C --> E[5. Execution and economy layer]

  G["Geometry layer<br/>tiles, blockers, paths, portals, occupancy"]
  S["Semantic layer<br/>zones, objects, tags, value, roles"]
  A["Affordance layer<br/>what can be used, bought, opened, queried, traded"]
  C["Agent cognition layer<br/>perception, memory, role policy, planning"]
  E["Execution and economy layer<br/>events, offers, x402, STX, sBTC, USDCx"]
```

This means:
- geometry tells the system where things are
- semantics tells the system what things mean
- affordances tell agents what they can do
- cognition helps agents choose meaningful actions
- execution handles the resulting world or economic action

This is the path from:
- random NPC wandering
to
- a world where agents understand places, objects, and value

### System Diagram

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[Experience Layer] --> B[Game Core]
  B --> C[AI Layer]
  B --> D[Persistence Layer]
  C --> D
  E[External Integrations] --> D

  A["Experience Layer<br/>maps, art, characters, dialogue UI"]
  B["Game Core<br/>movement, collisions, quests, items, NPC runtime"]
  C["AI Layer<br/>Braintrust dialogue, future memory and planning"]
  D["Persistence Layer<br/>Convex state and normalized cached records"]
  E["External Integrations<br/>AIBTC, Zero Authority, x402 on Stacks"]
```

### Module Boundaries

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  R[Apps/tinyrealms]
  R --> S[src/engine]
  R --> U[src/ui]
  R --> L[src/lib]
  R --> C[convex/story]
  R --> A[convex/agents]
  R --> I[convex/integrations]
  R --> M[convex/mechanics]

  S["src/engine<br/>runtime and rendering"]
  U["src/ui<br/>screens and presentation"]
  L["src/lib<br/>shared client helpers"]
  C["convex/story<br/>AI dialogue and narrative"]
  A["convex/agents<br/>planned agent sandbox"]
  I["convex/integrations<br/>planned external adapters"]
  M["convex/mechanics<br/>items, economy, combat"]
```

### Stacks Integration Direction

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  G[stacks2d / TinyRealms] --> X[AIBTC Adapter]
  G --> Z[Zero Authority Adapter]
  G --> P[x402 Adapter]
  X --> AX[AIBTC services]
  Z --> ZX[Zero Authority API]
  P --> PX[x402 API / sponsor relay]
```

### Payment and Execution Direction

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  H[Human or agent] --> I[World object or NPC]
  I --> O[Offer metadata in Convex]
  O --> X[x402 service boundary]
  X --> C[Stacks settlement path<br/>STX, sBTC, USDCx]
  X --> R[Premium content or action result]
  R --> I
```

Today:
- offer metadata is real
- premium UI is real
- payment execution is not live yet

That distinction is deliberate and should be preserved in public grant language.

### Why Semantics Matter

Without semantics, a room is just background art.

With semantics, the system can know:
- a coffee mug is a consumable object
- a swap terminal is a finance object
- a billboard is a media object
- a guide desk is a social and information zone
- a premium booth can expose an x402 offer

That is what makes:
- ai-town style behavior
- creator economy objects
- autonomous agents
- future trading agents
possible inside the same world model

## Modes

- **Play** — explore the world and interact with characters
- **Build** — edit the map, collision, and placement data
- **Sprites** — define and preview custom sprite animations

## Attribution

This repository builds on the TinyRealms foundation while taking the product in a different direction around semantic worlds, AI agent simulation, and Stacks/Bitcoin-native economic primitives.
